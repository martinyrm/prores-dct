# GLSL Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (for 10-bit ProRes)
This repository contains a port of FFmpeg's ProRes iDCT to GLSL, including OpenGL host code, and verification tests. This is a na√Øve translation from [libavcodec/simple_idct_template.c](libavcodec/simple_idct_template.c), where no attempt has been made to optimise for execution on GPU (e.g through a matmul implementation of the transform) and the shader operates on 8x8 blocks at a time using the separable fast iDCT.

## Verification
Reference transform data was obtained by running FFmpeg on a ProRes video sample. [libavcodec/proresdsp.c](libavcodec/proresdsp.c) was modified to write out all pre and post-transform DCT blocks to a file. 300 blocks from a real video sample [out2.mov](out2.mov) are used to verify the GLSL and Python implementations in this repository. [output.dat](output.dat) contains the output of the compute shader, while [ffmpeg_ref.dat](ffmpeg_ref.dat) contains the post-IDCT transform blocks as produced by FFmpeg.

## GLSL implementation
The shader can be found at [opengl/shader.comp](opengl/shader.comp). The transform is implemented as a compute shader, with an int16[64] wide SSBO used for passing the transform blocks in and out of the GPU. Each DCT block is passed to a new shader invocation in turn. OpenGL context and compute shader initialisation is based from work by [pondodev](https://github.com/pondodev/opengl_compute)

## Python implementation
Used as a testing platform - included at [python/](python/).
